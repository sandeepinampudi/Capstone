# Capstone
Taxonomy of technolgies : A sponsored project from LUX Research


The goal of my capstone project is to build an evolution tree of growing technologgies around the world.

To build this tree, I chose International Patent Classification (IPC) codes that are recorded in each publsihed patent related to each technology as ingredients.
